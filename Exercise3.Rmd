This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


The reason why is that different towns may have demographic differences. One town may have extremely poor residents, who are just more likely to turn to a life of crime, despite a higher presence of police. If we do not control for other variables, they could exert an effect on the dependent variable that is not correlated with our independent variable of interest. 
They used the instrumental variable of the event where there is heightened police presence without a crime rate-related trigger. They discovered that the “high alert” variable did exert a negative effect on crime occurrence. 
The control for “metro ridership” is to control for a proxy for population throughput in the area. We can reasonably assume that the more people in the area, the more likely a crime will be committed due to the increased presence of opportunity. 
The model estimated here places a differential on the effect of being on high alert on crime rate based on the geographic area in DC.

Report for Green Building.

By using a random forest model, I fitted a predicative model for the revenue per square foot per calendar that took in to considerations the age, stories, size and location of the building, as well as the build qualit. By building the partial depedence plot, I was able to isolated the effect of having a green certificated (LEED or Energy Star), to about $1.3 dollars increase in revenue. 


You can also embed plots, for example:

house_test  = testing(house_split)

head(house)

house_forest = randomForest(medianHouseValue ~. ,data = house_train)

house_train = house_train %>% 
  mutate (house_predict = predict(house_forest)) %>%
  mutate(house_resid =(predict(house_forest,house_test) - predict(house_forest)))
  
  
  qmplot(longitude, latitude, data = house, maptype = "toner-lite", color=medianHouseValue)+
  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis")+
  ggtitle("Orginal Data")

qmplot(longitude, latitude, data = house_train, maptype = "toner-lite", color=house_predict)+

  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis")+
  ggtitle("Residuals")


modelr::rmse(house_forest,house_test)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
